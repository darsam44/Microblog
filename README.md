<h1> Microblog </h1>

Micro blog is a blog service that allows saving, updating and reading blog posts (simple text).

Create a RESTful JSON API to handle the post resource (create, update, read, delete).

A user can “Like” a blog post.

The service should also expose an API endpoint for receiving top trending(consider both created time and number of “likes”) posts.

The service accepts JSON requests and responds with a JSON response.
